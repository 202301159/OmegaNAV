# OmegaNAV
OmegaNAV is a smartphone-based localisation system combining Dead Reckoning and SLAM for real-time, accurate navigation. Built for the Control of Autonomous Systems course, it fuses IMU and vision data, overlays trajectories, and analyses drift vs correction — powering research in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems.
